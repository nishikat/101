Insertion Sort
	I made all my graphs go up to when the array size was 1000 because it was too much for
	for my computer to go up to 10000. The times that my computer did go to 10000, i was 
	able to see a quick glimpse of the kind of function graph it looked like but my 
	computer would end up frozen.Looking at the three graphs if insertion sort (best,worst,
	and average case) I see that the best case is definitely a lot faster since 
	the time is still at the 10^-3 on the graph versus worst case which has the y-axis 
	going to 0.6. Comparing this to the average graphs, the y-axis reached to .25 at most 
	for a array of a size of 1000.
	
	The best case graph looks more like a linear function of n, while the worst case looks 
	more similar to a quadratic function of n (n^2). Although the average cas time was 
	around half the worse case running time, it looked more like a quadratic function. 
	
Merge Sort
	In terms of graphs for Merge Sort, it seems that between the best case and worst and
	average case there isn't a big of a difference like with insertion sort. For example 
	the best case y-axis goes up to 0.018 while both the worst case and average case's y-axis
	goes up to 0.030. The running time of merging is linear to it's array. The worse, best,
	and average case running times all look similar to linear although it is a logarithmic
	 function. This is because of the large size of n.
	
	For both my insertion sort and merge sort graphs I noticed that the trend line was 
	easy to spot but it was a smooth line. I dont know what could have caused the 
	sporadic results in some cases.
